  Hi and thank you for stopping by!

  Let me use this opportunity to present myself.

  Being initiated to hard puzzles at an early age through MYST by my dad, I developed a passion for figuring out how things work.
  I am now a physicist, because I like to describe them with a clear and precise language 
  and a Python programmer, because I also like contradictions.

  In the last years I dived into the amazing field of accelerator physics,
  while at the same time developing my coding skills - from _"physicist"_
  to _"readable"_ and sometimes even _"nicely documented"_ - thanks to the help, inspiration and criticism from very talented colleagues.
  
  Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=AxIC3M4AAAAJ) for the science part
  and my [Github](https://github.com/JoschD) for the codes.

          I am currently writing my PhD Thesis 
          _"Corrections of high-order nonlinearities in the LHC and High Luminosity LHC beam optics"_.

          Expertedly supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Jankowiak](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/vkart.pl?v=adzou), 
          who made my start at `CERN` already much easier by providing me with his lecture materials beforehand.

          With the background of my bachelor's studies, the fundamental physics course at the TU-Berlin were the logical choice on the way to obtain a master's degree.
          After a short intermezzo as an intern at `ABB` and `BAM` to get an insight of a researcher's life,
          I did two semesters of lectures at the TU, before working full-time on my thesis at the `HHI`
          about [_"Quality-of-transmission estimation in physical impairment-aware flexible optical networks"_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06477).

          I chose the studies of computational physics, as the curriculum required to attend the basic courses
          of the other natural sciences as well, and I did not yet feel finished with biology and chemistry.
          In addition, all laboratory work was replaced by lectures in simulations and optimization theory, 
          and the fundamental lectures of programming and computer science were mandatory. 
          It was indeed an ideal curriculum to start a career in modern natural sciences, in which the use of computers becomes even more prevalent than laboratories.

          Outside of the core curriculum, I enjoyed the philosophic-astronomic-meta-physical lectures of 
          [Prof. Roland Buser](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Buser) a lot, and I hope that they are still a thing.

        title:  Accelerator Physics
        description: |
          I started with accelerator physics in 2017 at my first Job at `CERN`. 
          In the [**Optics Measurements and Correction Team**](https://pylhc.github.io/),
          we are developing new methods to find errors in the LHC beam optics (read: magnetic fields) 
          and are finding new ways to correct them efficiently.

        title: Computational Physics 
        description: |
          I have a passion for working at the intersection between reality and simulation, 
          enjoying coding much more than setting up experiments and finding new solutions to problems by putting them into algorithms.
          During my bachelor's, I was introduced to different methods of optimization and ways to simplify complex object interactions without loosing the important features.

        title: Python 
        description: |
          Most of my coding is done in python, mainly for its simplicity and because speed is rarely the most important factor in my calculations.
          I am very comfortable in it and - in my opinion - know how to write pythonic, readable, well documented code.
          If there is time.
          One should also not underestimate the amount of problems solvable by sprinkling some regular expressions here and there.

          I am especially versed in pandas for data analysis, numpy and scipy.

        title: Java 
        description: |
          The language I learned in university (apart from Fortran, which I will not mention here, so no one contacts me to write some Fortran) and still use sometimes.
          At CERN, the GUI is written in Java, to which I have made multiple extensions and fixes.
          I find it very clunky though, and it is not my preferred language.
      
      - layout: left 
        title: MATLAB 
        description: |
          MATLAB was my main programming language during university as well as during the internships at 
          `ABB`, `BAM`  and during my master's at `HHI`. Only when starting at `CERN` it was replaced by Python as my go-to programming language.

        title: C++ 
        description: |
          While I have programmed in C++ for some courses in university, I have not properly used it for many years.
          I am sure that the knowledge would come back quickly if needed.

          I wanted a picture of a dodecapole. 
          Sadly, none of the pictures I found were to my liking.
          Instead of drawing a dodecapole I thought it would be more fun to write some code to plot all kinds of fields.<br>

          A lot of accelerator optics simulations involve the use of MAD-X.
          As I am not very happy with the language provided by MAD-X, 
          as are many others, I am using the pythonic approach thanks to the amazing 
          [cpymad wrapper](https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad).
          In this repo I collected a lot of functions, which are of great use to run
          cpymad simulations for the LHC and HL-LHC.
          
          I hope they can, if not used directly, at least provide some inspiration how to 
          overcome the limitations of MAD-X in a pythonic way!

          I try not to live too far away from hills and mountains throughout my life, as my sportive hobbies include 
          - mountain biking
          - climbing
          - bouldering 
          - via ferrata 
          - skiing/snowboarding.

          On rainy days however, you will find me on my couch gaming, watching [YouTube Videos about Space Time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g), 
          reading a fantasy or sci-fi book or jumping around within VR slaying virtual boxes.
