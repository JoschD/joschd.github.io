  Hi and thank you for stopping by!

  Let me use this opportunity to introduce myself.

  Being initiated to hard puzzles at an early age through <mark>MYST</mark> by my dad, I developed a passion for figuring out how things work.
  I am now a <mark>physicist</mark>, because describe them with a clear and precise language 
  and a <mark>Python</mark> programmer, because I also like contradictions.

  In the last years I have been introduced to the amazing field of <mark>accelerator physics</mark>,
  while at the same time develop my coding skills, thanks to very talented colleagues, from "physicist"
  to "readable" and sometimes even "nicely documented". 
  Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=AxIC3M4AAAAJ) for the Science part
  and my [Github](https://github.com/JoschD) for the Codes.

          I am currently writing my PhD Thesis 
          **"Corrections of high-order nonlinearities in the LHC and High Luminosity LHC beam optics"**.

          Expertedly supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Jankowiak](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/vkart.pl?v=adzou), 
          who made my start at CERN already much easier by providing me with his lecture materials beforehand.

          The <mark>fundamental physics</mark> studies at the TU-Berlin were the next logical step on the way to a Master's degree.
          After a short intermezzo as an intern at `ABB` and `BAM` to get inside into the research worklife 
          I did two semester of lectures here, before working full time on my thesis at the `HHI`
          about [**"Quality-of-transmission estimation in physical impairment-aware flexible optical networks"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06477).

          I chose the studies of <mark>Computational Physics</mark>, as the curriculum required to attend the basic courses
          of the other natural sciences as well, and I did not feel finished yet with <mark>Biology</mark> and <mark>Chemistry</mark>.
          Also, all laboratory work was replaced with lectures about <mark>simulations</mark> and <mark>optimization</mark> theory, 
          and the fundamental lectures in <mark>programming</mark> and <mark>Computer Science</mark> were mandatory. 
          It was indeed a perfect curriculum and a great starting point into a career in natural sciences.

          On a more extended curriculum bases I enjoyed the philosophic-astronomic-meta-physical lectures of 
          [Prof. Roland Buser](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Buser) a lot, and I hope that they are still a thing.

        title:  Accelerator Physics
        description: |
          I started with accelerator physics in 2017 at my first Job at CERN. 
          In the [**Optics Measurements and Correction Team**](https://pylhc.github.io/) we are developing new methods to find errors in the LHC beam optics (read: magnetic fields) 
          and are finding new ways to correct them efficiently.

        title: Computational Physics 
        description: |
          I love working at the intersection between reality and simulation, loving coding much more than setting up experiments 
          and loving finding new solutions to problems by putting them into algorithms.
          During my Bachelor's I was introduced to different methods of optimization and how to simplify complex object interactions without loosing the important features. 

      - layout: left 
        title: Python 
        description: |
          Most of my coding is done in python, mainly for the simplicity aspect and because I rarely rely on speed.
          I am very comfortable in it and - in my opinion - know how to write pythonic, readable, well documented code.
          If there is time.

          Especially versed in <mark>pandas</mark> for <mark>data analysis</mark>, <mark>numpy</mark> and <mark>scipy</mark>.
          And do not underestimate the amount of problems one can solve by sprinkling some <mark>regular expressions</mark> in there.

        title: Java 
        description: |
          The language learned in Uni (apart from Fortran, which I will not mention here, so no one contacts me to write some Fortran) and still used sometimes.
          At CERN the GUI is written in Java, to which I have made multiple extensions and fixes.
          I find it very clunky, though and it is not my preferred language.

        description: | 
          A lot of accelerator optics simulations involve the use of <mark>MAD-X</mark>.
          As I am not very happy with the language provided by <mark>MAD-X</mark>, 
          as are many others, I am using the pythonic approach thanks to the amazing 
          [<mark>cpymad</mark> wrapper](https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad).
          In this repo I collected a lot of functions, which are of great use to run
          <mark>cpymad</mark> simulations for the <mark>LHC</mark> and <mark>HL-LHC</mark>.
          
          I hope they can, if not used directly, at least provide some inspiration of how to 
          overcome the limitations of <mark>MAD-X</mark> in a pythonic way!

          This package provides tools for particle accelerator physics complementing the optics measurement analysis tools of the omc3 package.
