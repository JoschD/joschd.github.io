  Hi and thank you for stopping by. Let me use this opportunity to introduce myself.
  Being introduced into hard puzzles at an early age through MYST by my dad,
  I developed a passion for figuring out how things work.
  I am now a <mark>physicist</mark>, because describe them with a clear and precise language 
  and a <mark>Python</mark> programmer, because I also like contradictions.

  In the last years I have been introduced to the amazing field of <mark>accelerator physics</mark>,
  while at the same time develop my coding skills, thanks to very talented colleagues, from "physicist"
  to "readable" and sometimes even "nicely documented". 
  Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=AxIC3M4AAAAJ) for the Science part
  and my [Github](https://github.com/JoschD) for the Codes.

          I am currently writing my PhD Thesis 
          <mark>Corrections of high-order nonlinearities in the LHC and High Luminosity LHC beam optics</mark>.

          Expertedly supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Jankowiak](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/vkart.pl?v=adzou), 
          who made my start at CERN already much easier by providing me with his lecture materials beforehand.

          The fundamental physics studies at the TU-Berlin were the next logical step on the way to a Master's degree.
          After a short intermezzo as an intern at `ABB` and `BAM` (see Experience) to get inside into the research worklife 
          I did two semester of lectures here, before working full time on my thesis at the `HHI` (see Experience)
          about [<mark>Quality-of-transmission estimation in physical impairment-aware flexible optical networks</mark>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06477).

          I chose the studies of Computational Physics, as the curriculum required to attend the basic courses
          of the other natural sciences as well, and I did not feel finished yet with Biology and Chemistry.
          Also, all laboratory work was replaced with lectures about simulations and optimization theory, 
          and the fundamental lectures in programming were mandatory. 
          It was indeed a perfect curriculum and a great starting point into a career in natural sciences.

          On a more extended curriculum bases I enjoyed the philosophic-astronomic-meta-physical lectures of 
          [Prof. Roland Buser](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Buser) a lot, and I hope that they are still a thing.

          Trying to live not too far away from high hills and mountains throughout my life, as my sportive hobbies include 
          - Mountain Biking
          - Climbing
          - Bouldering 
          - Via Ferrata 
          - Ski/Snowboarding

          On rainy days, though you will find me on my couch gaming, reading a book or jumping around within VR slaying virtual boxes.
